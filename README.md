### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Juan Jose Gomez Rodriguez from Colombia. (It's Colombia, not Columbia)
ðŸ”­ I am a current researcher and PhD student at the AKR2 training nuclear reactor of the TU Dresden, Germany. 
I love :heart_eyes: learning languages, I speak fluently 4 languages: spanish, portuguese, english and italian. Currently, I'm working on my german skills. 

In the past, I worked as a seismological analyst at the Geological Colombian Survey (Check it at: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031920121000340?via%3Dihub) after finishing my bachelor degree in Physics. Then, I studied my master degree of nuclear engineering at UniPisa in Italy and worked at the AKR2 and at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Nonproliferation as intern. 

Nowadays, I'm mastering my skills in neutronics, thermal-hydraulics, nuclear safety, fuel behaviour and strctural mechanics. Currently, working in a project to investigate about cross sections data obtention with experiments at the AKR2 and in the validation of open-source codes in the nuclear field.
