### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Juan Jose Gomez but some people call me "Juanito" :baby:. 

I'm a second year master student of Nuclear Engineering :books: at the University of Pisa, Italy :it: and currently I'm working in Vienna during my internship on topics of safeguards and safety. Currently, my own research project tries to analyse the public social acceptance of nuclear energy using Natural Language Processing-NLP and social vision about nuclear issues and potential nuclear war. 

I love :heart_eyes: learning languages, I speak fluently 4 languages: spanish, portuguese, english and italian. Currently, I'm working on my french skills :fr:

I've worked in seismological monitoring, signal processing and dosimetry. After my bachelor of physics, I was interested in geophysics and I feel very proud of having published together with one of my best friends an article on early signals to forecast earthquakes where we developed a code from scratch :computer:. We used electromagnetical methods and we found anomalies for a large earthquake :earth_americas: in Colombia. More about it at: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031920121000340?via%3Dihub 

Nowadays, I'm mastering my skills in deterministic and montecarlo codes for lattice and core calculations in reactor physics. I have performed multiple courses, trainings, codes, etc. and hopefully will be my motivation for the next years. :arrow_right:.
